CodeOps Code of Conduct

*Last Updated: 14-05-18*

CodeOps is a continuous learning community about DevOps. We aim to facilitate a neutral place where members have access to the most innovative, inspirational and transformational DevOps content, practices and principles. 

We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout all CodeOps events.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any CodeOps event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout events.
